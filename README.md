The application uses MAMP, the local server environment to connect to the database, therefore in order to run it, first you have to download and install MAMP, if you already not have it.

The next step is to set the MySQL port to the number "8889" in MAMP preferences. Start the server by clicking the button "Start" and you are good to go. Run the app with "gradle run"
command.
